# OpenArkanoid
I proudly present an open-source rendition of the iconic video game classic, Arkanoid. Crafted in Java, this project showcases my dedication to expanding my programming skills while incorporating principles and data structures learned during my computer science studies. The self-designed sprites and efficient collision detection, based on an Interval-Interval-Tree implementation are features of this project.

Motivated by a deep appreciation for the original Arkanoid, I embarked on this project not only to explore and enhance my Java programming proficiency but also to experiment with my modifications to the beloved classic. The game serves as a testament to my commitment to continuous learning and application of theoretical concepts in practical scenarios.

I would like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to Kevin Richey for generously providing the West_England font, accessible via https://www.fontspace.com/west-england-font-f9616. Special thanks to catchspider for the captivating and customizable backgrounds, available at https://github.com/catchspider2002/svelte-svg-patterns. Additionally, I appreciate Pixabay for offering an array of sound effects, and credit goes to Eric Fredricksen and DrPetter for their contributions, sourced respectively from https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/ and https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/. Last but not least, I express my thanks to the jdeploy devs for their invaluable service.

Feel free to explore, contribute, and enjoy the enhanced gameplay of Arkanoid in this open-source adaptation
